Hello , I hope you don't mind a message in English. 

I am interested in your offer :) I am a young professional looking for an apartment to live alone. I will be willing to take over the kitchen too. 

My name is Vanisa Vongphanakhone and I come from Laos. I currently work full-time in the international education research organization in Hamburg, with an unlimited contract. My net income at the moment is 2200 euros. Before moving to Hamburg, I studied for a masters degree in Mannheim for two years. I have been in Hamburg for almost two years now and I am currently looking for a flat to live alone so I can move out of my current WG.

I can provide my SCHUFA certificate and proof of my income if you would like to see them. Hope to hear back from you! 


Best regards,
Vanisa
